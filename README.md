# Calculator-kivy

This is a very basic calculator with similar UI as the android calculator.

Despite it being fully functional, there are some aspects I wish to add or clean up. for instance, when the evaluation gets too large, it shifts and shows only a few of the total values. This could be fixed by adding scientific notations.
